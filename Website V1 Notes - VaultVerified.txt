VaultVerified - Official Website Structure & Core Content (v1)
Purpose of this document This file is meant to give the development + design team a clear strategic understanding of what VaultVerified is, why it exists, what problems it solves, and how the website should be structured and flow.

1. Core Message & WHY This Matters 
The Problem We Exist to Solve
Modern payment fraud is not random and not caused by careless employees.
Fraud today happens because:
● Attackers gain access to legitimate corporate email accounts
● They impersonate real employees from inside the email system
● They silently create email rules that reroute or hide messages
● They observe invoice timing, vendor relationships, approval flows
● They wait until the perfect moment to redirect payments
This is Business Email Compromise (BEC).
Traditional controls fail because:
● Email itself is treated as a trusted channel
● Banking changes are approved via email and phone calls
● Identity is assumed, not proven
● Compliance focuses on documentation after the damage is done
VaultVerified's Philosophy
Email should never be a system of record for money.
VaultVerified removes sensitive financial actions from email entirely and replaces them with:
● Verified identity
● Secure workflows
● Real-time validation
● Documented audit trails
We do not just detect fraud - we eliminate the conditions that allow it to happen.

2. What Makes VaultVerified Different (High-Level Pillars)
These concepts should subtly guide design, spacing, and hierarchy:
1. Prevention over reaction
2. Identity over intent
3. Process over policy
4. Trust through verification
5. Compliance built-in, not bolted-on
The site should feel:
● Calm
● Authoritative
● Structured
● Non-alarmist
● Enterprise-grade
No hype. No fear tactics. Just clarity.

4. HOME PAGE - STRUCTURE & DRAFT CONTENT
Section 1: Hero (Above the Fold)
Primary Message:
Secure payment changes. Verified identity. Built-in compliance.
Subtext:
VaultVerified prevents ACH and wire fraud by removing banking changes from email, verifying real identities, and creating an auditable, compliant verification process.
CTAs:
● Request a Demo
● Get Started

Section 2: Why Fraud Happens (Education First)
Headline:
Fraud doesn't start with a bad actor - it starts with a trusted email.
Content (Your Definition - Editable):
Fraud happens after someone gains access to your email system.
Attackers impersonate real employees from inside their actual email accounts. They create rules that route messages away from the inbox, allowing them to sit silently inside the organization.
They watch:
● Vendor communications
● Invoice timing
● Approval patterns
● Payment schedules
At the right moment, they send instructions - using your real email - to redirect funds to accounts they control.
By the time fraud is detected, the transaction is complete.

Section 3: The Core Failure
Headline:
Email was never meant to be a financial system.
Key Points:
● Banking changes sent via email cannot be trusted
● Identity is assumed, not verified
● Approvals lack audit-grade evidence
● Compliance requirements are increasing
VaultVerified removes email from the equation.

Section 4: How VaultVerified Works (High-Level)
Three Pillars (Visual Cards):
1. Secure Banking Vault
Real-time banking information and updates - never exchanged via email.
2. NACHA-Compliant Verification
Documented identity verification and reporting aligned with evolving standards.
3. Outsourced Verification & Fraud Operations
A dedicated verification function without hiring or scaling internal teams.
